# Do Tell Journal client

This repo contains all frontend code for my journaling application Do Tell.

I'm working towards a first version to test with users. No data will be saved to the backend, everything is kept on the client. The first version should be able to:
- :white_check_mark: Show, edit and add journals.
- :white_check_mark: Show text & audio entries.
- :white_check_mark: Add and edit text entries.
- :construction: Add audio entries.
- :construction: Edit audio entries.

> :warning: This application is currently actively being worked on. Functionality can change and/or break until the first stable version is released. 

You can view and play around with the application [here](https://main.d3kqu2vzx0imp9.amplifyapp.com/journal/J-8cae).
